# GraphQL Primer

GraphQL is an open spec for a flexible API layer. It re-imagines how you query, mutate, and react to data. To best understand the advantages of GraphQL, some context on the shortcomings of APIs need to be observed.

## APIs and Protocols

An API is an Application Programming Interface. Put simply, it is a way for two pieces of software talk to each other.

A Protocol defines the way two entities communicate.

Typical web and mobile applications have a three-tier architecture.

- A front-end: Mobile Application, Website, Desktop Application
- A back-end: A server or collection of cloud functions
- Data storage: Databases and file storage

GraphQL builds on top of various protocols to provide a more flexible way to interact with a "backend".
